# Activity Classifier

Uses machine learning to classify activity using the WISDM (Kwapisz, Weiss and Moore (2010). Activity Recognition using Cell Phone Accelerometers, Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery from Sensor Data (at KDD-10), Washington DC.) dataset. Trained a 1D Convolutional Neural Network using Keras in Python and achieved a testing accuracy of 85%.

# Features Achieved

- Model trained and tested.
- App to collect data for new focus with Apple Watch Companion.

# Features To Be Achieved

- Change focus from activity to exercises.
- Collect data using Apple Watch and retrain model on new data.
- Make final application as well as Apple Watch companion.
- Export model to iOS application using CoreML to run model predictions locally on device.
